EcoSim is a simulation designed to replicate economical patterns in the real world. It simulates people and their financial decisions, and the overall economy as a whole. Soon, AI will be implemented to test multiple scenarios and ideas.
One of such ideas is to use an AI with the only goal of making as much money as possible, and seeing what its strategy is.
There are other ideas that may be implemented, but we want to flush out the simulation first.
DM import_laziness on Discord for more information / if you want to help the project.
